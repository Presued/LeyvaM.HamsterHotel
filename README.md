# LeyvaM.HamsterHotel

Project:Hamster Hotel 

Language: HTML5, Css, and Bootstrap

For HamsterHotel everybody had to create a mirror image of a website they they gave us and told us to create it exactly the original


Peer Review: Arely Martinez - I saw that the amenities were missing the text under the icons. I ask Maunel if maybe it appeared different on my screen but he said he left it out. I told him how he could appraoch and and was willing to improve his code!! His laptop display looked great and resembled the prototype in all areas like fonts its sizing, image sizing, etc. I would say maybe more time couldve been spent on fixing the reservation portion, otherwise looks great!!
